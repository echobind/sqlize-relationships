inspired by [blog post on sequelize relationships](https://medium.com/@eth3rnit3/sequelize-relationships-ultimate-guide-f26801a75554) and a [blog post on graphql, node.js, apollo server, and sequelize](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-graphql-server-in-node-js-with-apollo-server-and-sequelize)

bootstrapped with [sequelize-graphql-next-template](https://github.com/nathanBrenner/sequelize-graphql-next-template) and [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
